# 2. Advanced CSS Challenge: Professional Portfolio

## Description

Welcome to my portfolio! To complete this weeks challenged, I incorporated all of the HTML and CSS skills I have learned up this point in order to create my very own Professional Portfolio. Not only did I employ CSS in creating a precise layout, I also implemented advanced CSS techniques such as pseudo-classes to create hover effects on the page! Currently there is placeholder text in the "About Me" section as well as placeholder text and images for most of the project cards in the "Work" section. As I learn and grow as a developer in the coming weeks, I plan on updating both of these sections to reflect my progress.
